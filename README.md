In the project directory, you can run:

    npm start: Starts the development server.
    npm build: Builds the app for production to the build folder.
    npm test: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
    npm eject: If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
